Geometry Dash FC


Responsibilities:

Jacob - Menu screen, icon selection, instructions screen, testing game physics, adding pictures

Andy - Gameplay, creating the level, adding music, testing game physics


How to play:

- Press the space bar or the up arrow to jump.

- Dodge the spikes and land on the blocks. Do not hit the side of the blocks.

- Reach the pink rectangle to win.

- Press Esc to pause game; click anywhere to continue.


Missing functionalities:

- Missing levels and gameplay: There was not enough time to create the entire level, so the level is shorter than usual.

- Game modes - Only the cube was introduced. The ship was planned to be introduced, but had to be scrapped at the last second due to time restraints.

- Practice mode - A little too complex.


Additional functionalities:

- Different music for level complete screen: Normally, the level music would keep playing when the level is complete.

- Noclip: It allows the player to clip through obstacles without dying. Typically, it is an external hack. This game has it built in - just click the toolbox icon to play through the level with Noclip on.


Bugs:

- Jump buffer: If double-clicking the space bar or up key, the jump is delayed after the icon hits the ground.

- Last-second jump: The icon doesn't jump until the last possible frame on a block. Sometimes, it doesn't jump at all.

- Inaccurate hitboxes: The icon may clip through a block or spike without dying due to inaccurate hitboxes.

- Text not showing when game is paused.


Additional info:

- File may be very large.
